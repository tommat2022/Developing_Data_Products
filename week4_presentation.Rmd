## My Shiny Application

 This is a Shiny application as the project of "Developing Data Products" course. I developed the shiny web which predicts the Chiba Prefecture COVID-19 new patients after 7day by using neighboring region such as Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama and Ibaraki Prefectures.  
 Choosing the number of today's new cases of neighboring region, the shiny website calculate the number of forecast of Chiba Prefecture 7 days ahead.
 
 The shiny application is on https://tom-mat.shinyapps.io/Week4_Shiny_Application/  
 
 Shiny application (ui.R and server.R) code is in the following site: https://github.com/tommat2022/Developing_Data_Products  
 
## COVID-19 Japan dataset  
 The column "Chiba_afterweek" shows the new cases of Chiba Prefecture 7 days ahead between 2021/01/01 and 2023/02/3  (dataset: new_case_select).
```{r dataset, echo=T}
new_case_select <- read.csv("new_case_select.csv")
head(new_case_select)
```

## Neighboring region of Chiba Prefecture

## Multiple linear regression model
 The current new cases of neighboring region explain 82.8% of the forecast of Chiba
```{r regression, echo=T, strip.white=T, results='markup'}
logit <- lm(Chiba_afterweek ~ Tokyo + Kanagawa + Saitama + Ibaraki, data=new_case_select)
summary(logit)[4]; summary(logit)[9]
```

## Plot Example:   
Tokyo and Chiba 7 days ahead
```{r}
new_case_select %>% ggplot(aes(x=Tokyo, y=Chiba_afterweek)) + geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method="lm", formula=y~x) + theme_bw()
```
